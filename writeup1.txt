Cribbage Bot Progress Report
============================

=== Match Results ===
Total Games: 100
ValueBot Wins: 90
RandomBot Wins: 10
ValueBot Win Rate: 90.00%


Current Methodology
-------------------
The current version of the Cribbage bot implements the following components:

1. **Core Game Engine**
   - Card and Deck classes for standard 52-card logic
   - A CribbageGame class that handles dealing, discarding, scoring, dealer switching, and match ending at 121 points
   - Full scoring implementation including 15s, pairs, runs, flushes, and knobs

2. **Discard Value Simulation**
   - A simulation (`analyze_card_values.py`) was run across 5,000 hands as both dealer and non-dealer
   - The impact of discarding each card rank was averaged across scenarios and stored in `expected_value_v1.json`
   - This data provides a relative expected value for discarding each rank, depending on whether the bot is the dealer or not

3. **Value-Based Player (ValueBot)**
   - Uses the expected value table to choose the best discard combination from 15 possible 2-card pairs
   - Chooses cards that maximize total discard value when dealer and minimize crib value when opponent is the dealer

4. **Simulation Framework**
   - A 100-game match between ValueBot and a baseline RandomBot was run
   - ValueBot won 90 out of 100 games (90% win rate)
   - The simulation tracked average score differences and win counts to benchmark performance

   
Future Improvements
-------------------
To enhance the Cribbage bot and move toward optimal play, the following steps are proposed:

1. **Pegging Phase Implementation**
   - Add the second phase of Cribbage: the pegging phase (play to 31)
   - This involves turn-based card play, tracking running totals, and scoring pairs/runs on the board

2. **Reinforcement Learning Integration**
   - Replace rule-based discard logic with a trainable agent (e.g., using DQN or PPO)
   - State space: 6-card hand (encoded) + dealer status
   - Action space: 15 possible discard combinations
   - Reward: hand score (+ crib score if dealer)

3. **Crib Value Prediction Model**
   - Build a lightweight crib evaluator that predicts expected crib value based on card combinations
   - Helps improve discard decisions beyond simple rank-based averages

4. **Self-Play and Tournament Mode**
   - Enable multiple bots (value-based, random, RL-based) to play round-robin tournaments
   - Track win rates, score differentials, and decision logs

5. **Better Evaluation**
   - Plot win rates and score differences over time
   - Track discard decisions and crib contributions separately
   - Compare agents not just by win rate but also by consistency and error margin

6. **Web Interface or CLI Dashboard**
   - Add a simple interface to watch games play out or to test discard decisions manually
